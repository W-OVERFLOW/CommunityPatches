# MC Bug Checklist
* Those bugs that have been open for years and purposefully ignored by mojang
  are no-gos.
* Must be a bug in a stable release (not in a snapshot, future release, etc)
* Must have a meaningful impact to a player. (even a niche one)
* Before trying to fix a bug, make sure you can reproduce it.
* Must be a bug that has been confirmed and open in the bug tracker.
