## What if I want to enable some bug fixes, but not others?
Debugify has a configuration GUI accessible by Fabric's [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) or Forge's Built-in mod list.
If you don't want to use either of them, there is always the configuration file located at
`.minecraft/config/debugify.json`

## Client, or Server?
Debugify includes many fixes for both the client and server (all server fixes also apply to client).
So you should definitely use it on both.

## Can I include this in my modpack?
Yes! Of course! We even hid a little feature in the mod for you! The constant updates may be exhausting to maintain,
so we added a config option that defaults new bug fixes to off, until you get round to looking at it.

```json5
{
  // ...
  "default_disabled": true
}
```
