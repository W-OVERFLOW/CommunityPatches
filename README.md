# Debugify
## What the hell is debugify?
Debugify is a community project to clean up the forgotten bugs of Minecraft found on the Minecraft bug tracker, fixing those pesky bugs with a low priority from Mojang that they never get around to.

## Should I use it on client, or server?
You can use it on both! There are a lots of fixes for both the server and the client.
